                                    <p><acronym title="Create Life Again Ministries">CRELAM</acronym> (Create Life Again Ministries) is a Christian child care and  development ministry aimed at releasing children from spiritual, economic, social and physical poverty in Jesus’ name. We are community-based: We believe that Christianity is God’s chosen instrument to bring hope to a hurting world. We also believe that children are an inheritance from the lord God and so should be protected and guarded if this role is to be harnessed.  We feel that their needs should be addressed holistically to ensure that God’s intended purpose for them is realized. Our vision, mission and strategic objectives are focused towards achieving the overall purpose of God for these children. We show the love of Jesus to the needy and vulnerable children and their families so as to make the good news of the gospel acceptable to the communities.</p>
                                    <p>We are child-focused: CRELAM is focused on the individual child and his/her development. We offer this assistance irrespective of caste, creed, class or religion. At CRELAM, we believe entire communities will feel the positive impact of our presence because what happens in the life of a child ripples throughout his or her environment. We are Christ-centered: Jesus is the core of our ministry and his life and teachings shape our programs. They reflect the spiritual commitments of our staff. And they guide how we love people, respect communities and cooperate with nations. We are committed to integrity: We hold ourselves to the highest professional and biblical principles in all aspects of our ministry and maintain the highest industry standards for our allocation of funds. We are looking forward to welcoming child development partners from all over the world to partner with us to foster the work of God in the poor, orphaned and other vulnerable children.</p>
